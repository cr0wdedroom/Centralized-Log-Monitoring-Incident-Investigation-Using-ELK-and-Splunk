# Centralized-Log-Monitoring-Incident-Investigation-Using-ELK-and-Splunk


Built a centralized log monitoring setup using Windows 11 ARM, Kali Linux, and ELK Stack via Docker on Mac M1.

Forwarded Windows logs (Sysmon + Security) to ELK and Splunk Cloud for real-time analysis.

Simulated attacks (brute-force logins, PowerShell abuse) from Kali to generate actionable logs.

Created detection dashboards in Kibana and Splunk, monitoring failed logins and suspicious behavior.

Wrote custom SPL and KQL queries to detect anomalies and surface security events.

Investigated incidents end-to-end, documenting findings and mitigation in detailed reports.
