# Centralized-Log-Monitoring-Incident-Investigation-Using-ELK-and-Splunk


üõ°Ô∏èProject Objectives:

Deploy a centralized log monitoring lab using ELK Stack (via Docker) and Splunk Cloud.

Forward Windows logs (Sysmon + Event Logs) to ELK and Splunk for analysis and visualization.

Simulate real-world attacks from Kali (e.g., brute-force logins, suspicious PowerShell commands).

Create dashboards and write detection queries to surface anomalous behaviors and attack chains.

Showcase core SOC skills: log forwarding, detection engineering, dashboarding, and incident investigation.
